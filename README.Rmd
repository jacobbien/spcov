# spcov

This R package implements the estimator introduced in
[Bien, J., and Tibshirani, R. (2011), "Sparse Estimation of a Covariance Matrix," Biometrika](https://academic.oup.com/biomet/article/98/4/807/234877).

The easiest way to install `spcov` is by using the [devtools](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) R package (if not already installed, open R and type `install.packages("devtools")`). To install `spcov`, type the following from an R console:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("jacobbien/spcov")
```
